# 2048-game-simulator

2048 is a simple and popular game so I wrote a program that can win this game.

*game_2048* is a game itself, by running this you can play in terminal in 2048

*simulate_2048* is a simulation of *n* games with parameter *depth* - both of this can be set in main

*animate_2048* is an animation where you can see how computer decision looks like

There are the results of 100 simulations with depth = 2:
